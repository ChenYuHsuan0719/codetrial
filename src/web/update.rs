//! The update notice: whether the `latest` release names a different commit

//! The server asks GitHub and the lobby asks the server, so the page's
//! `connect-src` gains nothing and every open tab shares one answer. Nothing is
//! asked at all unless `CODETRIAL_UPDATE_CHECK` turned it on for a macOS build
//! CI made (`config::update_check_commit`).
//!
//! Every failure answers "no update": no network, a GitHub error, a rate limit,
//! and the window in which `latest` resolves to nothing while it is republished
//! all leave the lobby as it was, because a notice that only says the check
//! failed is not something a candidate can act on.
